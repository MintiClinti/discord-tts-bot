# discord-tts-bot
Discord bot that I tinkered around with over last summer. This bot is able to take in text and speak it out while it's in a Discord voice channel.
It utilized the discord.py, gTTS and mutagen libraries. 

discord.py : `pip install -U discord.py`

gTTS : `pip install gTTS`

mutagen : `pip install mutagen`

This project also needs ffmpeg in order to run; install link will be pasted.

or 

'git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg'


Thanks for checking this out
